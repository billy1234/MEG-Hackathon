## MEG HACKATHON

This project is from a 1 week hackathon I took part in during my time at Macquarie University. The goal was to predict age and gender using meg scan data.

Contained within this repo is another made by a teacher and orginiser I have opted to only include my contribution to this repo meaning some code and the raw data used are omitted here
